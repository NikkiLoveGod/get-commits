# Get commits

A simple bash script that goes through your Git repositories and prints out the commits that you or others have made during a given timespan. 

It's meant to answer the question "What did I do two days ago?" based on Git commits.

*TL;DR* - Runs `git shortlog` in multiple repos.

## Installation

* Clone this repo into somewhere in your filesystem.
* Optionally symlink the `git-commits.sh` script somewhere under your $PATHS, fe. `ln -s <path>/get-commits.sh /usr/local/bin/get-commits`

## Usage
```bash
$ ./get-commits.sh -h

Usage: ./get-commits.sh [...opts] -p "/paths/to /git/repos /separated/by/spaces"
Example: ./get-commits -a me@domain.com -p "/usr/repos/my-project /usr/repos/my-another-project" --update

  -a | --author   Limit commits to a given author.
  -s | --since    Include commits only after given timeframe. See git log --help for formatting options.
  -u | --update   Fetches latest commits before printing them.
  -h | --help     Print this help.
  -p | --paths    Space separated list of absolute paths into Git repositories.

```

## Example output
```bash
$ ./get-commits.sh -p /Users/nlg/dev/commitfinder                                                                             [10:42:23]
